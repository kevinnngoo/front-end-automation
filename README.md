### Technologies Used

- **React.js** ⚛️: For building the interactive user interface.
- **Axios** 🌐: For API requests to the backend service.
- **CSS/Styled Components** 🎨: For styling and responsive design.
- **React Router** 🔄: To handle routing between different pages (e.g., settings, tracker).
